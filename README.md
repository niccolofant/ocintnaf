### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm NiccolÃ²
---

My name is NiccolÃ² and I just graduated in IoT, Big Data & Web @ [UniUd](https://www.uniud.it/it). 
In my time at University of Udine, I've been lucky to have a multidisciplinary education and explore many fields of study; having these experiences has mainly enriched my practice as a web developer and software engineer.

Since the start of 2021 I've been also particularly interested in blockchain technology â€” in the last months I've developed some projects and attended a handful of courses regarding Web3.0, dApps, DeFi and NFTs.
I hope I can enrich my knowledge about these topics in the next years.
